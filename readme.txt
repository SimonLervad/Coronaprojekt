This files contains guides for how to setup and start using my TODO application

First u need to download the basic DB i have set up for you
Follow these instructions:

	1. open mongo in CMD or Terminal and start mongo
	2. type: "mongorestore -d todoApp --drop dump/todoApp"
 


Now with the database created for the application. you can now log in as
	John Doe - with following:

		John@doe.dk
		test123
	or
		nml@iba.dk
		test

	The user John Doe will have admin rights - which gives him the abillity to confirm other users and makes them admins aswell.
	If you want to add another user, you will have to login as John Doe and approve the other users, before they can login.

To give the full experience, login as John Doe first - explore the platform, afterwards you can try to create some TODO and add other users to the application.

Good luck
